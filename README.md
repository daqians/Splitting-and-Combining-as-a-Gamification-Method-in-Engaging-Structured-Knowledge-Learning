Splitting and Combining as a Gamification Method in Engaging Structured Knowledge Learning
Abstract: The understanding of the structure of knowledge is an essential step of education.However, although teachers offer the knowledge structure and relationship among knowledge points, there are still few methods to encourage students to explore the structure of knowledge by themselves outside of classes. In this paper, we explore the gamification method and the knowledge structure of computer science. We assess the gamification method of “splitting and combining” (SC) to encourage students to finish the process of learning structured knowledge. The results show that this method worked well in promoting learning enjoyment and that splitting demonstrated better performance than combining. We can consider the SC method when recommending a gamification method to engage students in structural learning assistance in future smart education.
